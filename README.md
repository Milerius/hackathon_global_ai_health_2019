**AI² – Smart lung diagnosis and personalized follow-up**

![logo](assets/Logo.png)

## Summary

Our innovative solution aims to leverage AI (machine learning) on two streams (AIxAI=AI²), lung patient diagnostic, and hospital administrative workflow, to both streamline specialist workload and patient experience.

We are improving these processes by:
- using a prediction model based on lung X-rays, to determine a lung patient pathology
- automating coordination between diagnosis and booking assistant tools (CRM), to propose a relevant personalized follow-up appointment with a lung specialist

We also remove friction points in the process by using user-friendly app for the patient (e.g. to set reminders, localization of appointment, etc.)
