AI² – Faster lung diagnosis and personalized follow-up

**How to enable radiologists to focus on more value-added core responsibilities, while leveraging a smart connected hospital ?**

## Summary

Our innovative solution aims to leverage AI (machine learning) on two streams, lung patient diagnostic, and hospital administrative workflow, to both streamline specialist workload and patient experience.

We are tackling these concepts using a prediction model based on lung X-rays, to determine a lung patient pathology, and automating the booking system (CRM), to propose a relevant personalized follow-up appointment with a lung specialist.
